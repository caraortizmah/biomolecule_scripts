### Plots
#### in python or jupyter notebook

Most of them need to be run in a python environment.
I use conda for activating the environtment for data visualization
`single_XAS_plot.ipynb` load a lot of data using globals() for creating
a large number of variable data and plot a single XAS from this data, chosen 
by the user in the notebook.
